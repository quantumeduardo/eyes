# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes

Description of project:
In this project we focused on the incorporation of css, html and javascript - all working together to have a set of eyes follow the user's mouse.

How to Run:

navigate to index.html and scroll over using your mouse to see the eyes move along with it.

Roadmap of future improvements:

with more experience it would be interesting to have the eyes blinking, setting the logic and styling for that can make this eye experience more vivid.
